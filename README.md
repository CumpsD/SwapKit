# üè° Getting Started

SwapKit is a suite of tools package as an SDK to facilitate integration of all THORSwap services. SwapKit SDK is open-source and powers the THORSwap frontend. It is an easy gateway to all THORchain features, as well as THORSwap tools. SwapKit has four main pillars:

1. Cross-chain quoting API with DEX Aggregation and transaction creation support
2. Wallet interaction for multiple chains
3. Cross-chain transactions tracking
4. Thorchain tooling and abstraction

### 1. TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

Implement our JS/TS SDK in any frontend, or backend, and build your UI/UX around cross-chain swaps.
